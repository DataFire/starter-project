# DataFire Sample Project

This is a sample project for [DataFire](https://github.com/DataFire/DataFire)

There are two paths defined in this project:

#### /hello_world

Returns a greeting. For example, `GET /hello_world?name=Lucy` will return `"Hello, Lucy"`.

This is driven by the `hello_world` action.

#### /gifs

Returns a feed of the links on Reddit's [r/gifs](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/)
